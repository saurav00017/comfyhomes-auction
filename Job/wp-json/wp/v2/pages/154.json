This is the second time you have moved me along in my career path and I am very grateful! Of course I told my current boss that he needs to talk to you when looking for my replacement. I hope you get them someone wonderful!\u201d<br />\u2013Lisa T.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just had my first quarterly evaluation yesterday. Apparently this company loves me and I love this company!

Again, my thanks and I will be happy to refer any qualified coders/HIM people to you in the future. My first experience with a recruiter was disappointing, so I am grateful for your level of knowledge about the HIM field and its sometimes peculiar nature, and for your utmost professionalism. I have certainly been the beneficiary of your diligent work.\u201d<br />\n\u2014 Jane W.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter 5 months of searching on my own, one call to H.I.M. Recruiters and I was on my way to finding my perfect job. If I had to do it over again, I would have called H.I.M. Recruiters first! Doug Ellie was able to narrow my goals, desires, talents and accomplishments down in such a way as to direct me to the most appropriate employer. I now have a new, exciting career ahead of me, thanks to his expertise in recruitment. Thanks, Doug and thank you H.I.M. Recruiters!\u201d<br />\n\u2014 Katie D.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerry has provided exemplary candidates to me as a hospital HIM client, and has also successfully placed me in exceptional jobs in the past. He is so well respected in the industry that everyone wants to work with him. I recommend him without reservation.\u201d<br />\n\u2014 Connie T.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is always a pleasant and positive experience working with Perry. He has a wide net of connections and colleagues and is the recruiter of choice for many healthcare organizations.\u201d<br />\n\u2014 Tamar G.</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain you have ushered in a new direction for my career progression!

I am well pleased!\u201d<br />\n\u2014 Lisa T.</p>\n<p>\u201cH.I.M.

Directed by a HIM professional, the firm is able to find top-ranking HIM positions and match renowned HIM careerists to specific qualifications due to Perry Ellie\u2019s long-standing, trusted presence within the HIM field. I would highly recommend his work for HIM professionals seeking opportunities at all levels.\u201d<br />\n\u2014 Dwan T.[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.0.6&#8243;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.0.6&#8243;]</p>\n<p>\u201cThis job is much more than I expected and could imagine.

I wish you continued success and if there is ever anything I can do for you, please do not hesitate to contact me.\u00a0 Thank you again, Perry.\u201d<br />\u2014 Sharon G.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe other two new team members and I are having a blast learning and becoming acquainted with each other.
