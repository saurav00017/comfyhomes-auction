Insure you are in a location where you will have no distractions. If you can have a mirror to look in, use it. Your facial expressions will reflect through your voice. If you are smiling, you will sound interested. If you are frowning, you will sound disinterested.</li>\n<li>Be Upbeat and Enthusiastic: You are only a resume, a piece of paper, to the potential employer. They likely have many resumes. Your enthusiasm/energy must stand out, but don&#8217;t sound phony.</li>\n<li>Speak clearly and slowly: Many people get very nervous during telephone interviews and may have a tendency to mumble into the phone. Relax, speak slowly. Do not sound rushed or anxious.</li>\n<li>Make preparation notes (questions): But do not write a script for the interview, just speak freely from your notes. See &#8220;Questions to ask&#8221; for further insights.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Phase II</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Be prepared to give highlights: Be prepared to give a positive two minute summary of your professional career. Rehearse this!</li>\n<li>Asks questions: You should talk and carry the conversation, not the employer. Avoid yes &amp; no answers. See &#8220;Questions to Ask&#8221; for further insights.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Determine what the employers\u2019 short-term concerns are. &#8220;How can I make an immediate impact on the job?&#8221; Tailor the balance of your responses to examples where you resolved similar concerns.</li>\n<li>Ask hiring authority what his/her background is. This provides you with insight and generally places each of you more at ease.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Phase III</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Have script for this item only&#8230; When you sense the conversation is ending, be proactive and ask&#8230; &#8220;I know you are busy, and there is only so much we can cover on the phone. Based upon what we have both shared, I would like to meet with you. I have my schedule in front of me, when do you think we can get together?&#8221; You always want to end the conversation knowing what the next step will be.</li>\n<li>Know your skeletons, such as job hopping, being fired. Avoid weak excuses. NEVER CRITICIZE YOUR FORMER EMPLOYERS. Role-play and rehearse your responses to difficult or uncomfortable issues that may come up in the conversation.</li>\n<li>Call H.I.M Recruiters with feedback and to share the results of your interview!</li>\n<li>NEVER ASK QUESTIONS IN THESE AREAS IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEWThere will be ample time to get these questions answered later or at the time of an offer.\n<ol>\n<li>Dollars</li>\n<li>Security</li>\n<li>Benefits</li>\n<li>Commute</li>\n<li>Comfort &amp; convenience</li>\n<li>Hours</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Call \u00a0H.I.M Recruiters with feedback and to share the results of your interview!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section][et_pb_section fb_built=&#8221;1&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.0.6&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#82be5a&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;0px||0px||false|false&#8221; global_module=&#8221;572&#8243;][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;4.0.6&#8243;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.0.6&#8243;][et_pb_cta title=&#8221;Start Your Job Search&#8221; button_url=&#8221;https://www.himjobs.com/search-jobs/&#8221; button_text=&#8221;Search Jobs&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.0.6&#8243; background_enable_color=&#8221;off&#8221;]</p>\n<p>View all of the HIM job opportunities available now.</p>\n<p>[/et_pb_cta][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section]</p>\n",
